            His mother revealed that, when she was pregnant with Ronaldo, she wanted to have an abortion due to poverty
            his father's heavy alcoholism and having too many children, but doctors refused to perform the procedure.
            Ronaldo converted to Catholicism , and was raised in a poor Catholic home, 
            sharing a room with all of his siblings.
            As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,  where his father worked as a kit man ,and then spent two years playing with Nacional .
            In 1997, aged 12, he had a three-day trial with Sporting CP , who signed him for a fee of £1,500.  He then moved from Madeira to Alcochete , a town near Lisbon , to join Sporting's youth academy.By the age of 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother to stop his education to focus entirely on football. Although popular with the other students at his school, Ronaldo was expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who Ronaldo claimed "disrespected" him. [ 18 ] However, a year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia , a condition that could force him to stop playing football. [ 19 ] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery in which a laser was used to burn several pathways in his heart into one, changing the way his heart beats when it is at rest.
